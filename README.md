# Periodic Table 3D

I recently developed a 3D Periodic Table application using Unity, and I'm excited to share it with the community! If you are a student, educator, or simply a science enthusiast, this tool might be perfect for you.

## What my project does:

The Periodic Table 3D allows users to explore the elements in an interactive 3D environment. You can rotate, zoom and click each element to view detailed information such as atomic number, mass, and various properties. The application aims to make learning about elements engaging and visually appealing.

## Comparison with existing alternatives:

Unlike traditional 2D periodic tables or static model, my Unity-based application offers an immersive experience that lets users engage with the elements dynamically. The interactivity and depth provided by the 3D view make it a unique educational tool compared to existing alternatives.

## Features:

* Fully interactive 3D visualization of the periodic table
* Clickable elements with detailed information displayed
* Smooth rotation and zoom functionalities
* User-friendly interface designed for easy navigation
* Available on Windows
